# Flask course - Baltic internships

Weekly tasks of the course will be uploaded here. I'm guessing, in this course, we will create a bare-bone functional Flask app.

##First week (deadline: Mar 25):

> For this assigment you will be creating a ver small flask application. Your application should:
>
>> have a route for /welcome, which responds with the string "welcome"
>>
>> have a route for /welcome/home, which responds with the string "welcome home"
>>
>> have a route for /welcome/back, which responds with the string "welcome back"

##Week 2 (deadline: Apr 1):

>You will continue to evolve previously created flask app:
>
>>1. Get weather report for a city of your liking via API call.
>
>>2. Create a route /weather which responds with received data (city name and current temperature in Celsius). Consider using a template to render and display data.
>
>>3. Optional task â€“ let user pick a city.
