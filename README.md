# Flask course - Baltic internships

Weekly tasks of the course will be uploaded here. I'm guessing, in this course, we will create a bare-bone functional Flask app.

First week (deadline: Mar 25):

> For this assigment you will be creating a ver small flask application. Your application should:
>
>> have a route for /welcome, which responds with the string "welcome"
>>
>> have a route for /welcome/home, which responds with the string "welcome home"
>>
>> have a route for /welcome/back, which responds with the string "welcome back"
